notes

what is a stochastic gradient

have we fine tubed the models to ensure the guasion/sigmoid comodelling

have we tried the model fully 

we need to break down the state based modelling

combine with databases 
- raw
- calculated
- interpreted i.e. the third derivitive or the rate of rates of change

have the machine decide when thresholds have been crossed - not missing any key features
- so options - what is the rash like ---> by having choices get to work on the data best 

*can we have AI diffusion images to help with this? --> ig uesss if you feed enough images in you could get something out [  ]*

then we have trials of interventions and the outcomes of those interventions
- are the outcomes fed back in with the raw data type of informatoin - and if on treatment; what escalation

the interventions need a cost benefit calulator - whether it will be cheaper to get a test, get pharmacy first (e.g. lowest risk on strep threshold and continue if working); free prescriptions? opporunity cost fomr not working
-squeeze it down to the cost of less than the cost of a latte 
-cant really sell it as a subscriptoin as lot to track
